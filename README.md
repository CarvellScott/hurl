This is sort of a really dumb experiment that surprisingly works.

Let's just say that I wanted a URL that's very unlikely to change and I didn't feel like setting something up on AWS...

...and I didn't feel like setting up static ip addresses.
...or using a dynamic dns service.
...or modifying /etc/hosts on several systems that aren't under my control.

It's more PoC than anything, but think of this as a really ghetto alternative to /etc/hosts or setting up your own DNS server for a single site.
